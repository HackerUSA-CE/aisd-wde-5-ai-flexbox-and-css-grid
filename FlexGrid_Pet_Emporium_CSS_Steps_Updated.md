## Coding Steps with AI Assistance

Now let's start coding with the help of AI.

### Let's start with the index.html steps

#### Steps to ask AI

1. **Add HTML Boilerplate with Web Page Title and Footer**
   - **What to ask AI:**
     Can you provide me with a detailed HTML boilerplate for a web page with a header, main content area, and footer, along with a linked CSS file, and title the page 'FlexGrids Pet Emporium'. Include an h1 tag in the header and a p tag in the main content area with a witty description for a pet store. This "witty description" should be a p tag with a class of "store-description".
   - **Where to place the provided code:**
     Copy the HTML boilerplate code provided by the AI and paste it into your `index.html` file.

2. **Add Navigation Bar Code**
   - **What to ask AI:**
     Can you provide me with HTML code to add a navigation bar with "Login," "Our Locations," and "Contact Us" options to my existing HTML boilerplate? The nav bar will be a black bar at the top once I style it.
   - **Where to place the provided code:**
     - Open your `index.html` file.
     - Locate the `<header>` tag in your `index.html` file. The `<header>` tag should be inside the `<body>` tags.
     - Paste the copied navigation bar code between the `<body>` and the `<header>` tags.

3. **Add Pet Image Boxes Section**
   - **What to ask AI:**
     Now that we have a navigation bar, let's add 12 boxes for the pet photos with cute pet names and short personality descriptions. Can you provide me with HTML code to add a section under the main content area with 12 image boxes for pet photos located in the `assets/images` folder? The photos are named Pet1.jpg to Pet12.jpg. Each box should have an image, a cute pet name, and a short personality description underneath. Please ensure this code uses a `<section>` tag with a class of "pet-gallery".  
   - **Where to place the provided code:**
     - Open your `index.html` file.
     - Locate the existing `<main>` tag in your `index.html` file. This tag should already contain the initial `<p>` tag with the business description.
     - Paste all the copied pet image boxes `<section>` code directly below the existing `<p>` tag inside the `<main>`. This will ensure that the pet image boxes section appears right after the business description.

4. **Add a Section for Location and Hours**
   - **What to ask AI:**
     Next, let's add a section for the location and hours. Can you provide me with HTML code to add a section for location and hours, including an address, phone number, and business hours? 
   - **Where to place the provided code:**
     - Open your `index.html` file.
     - Locate the existing `<footer>` tag in your `index.html` file.
     - Paste the copied location and hours section code directly above the `<footer>` tag.

5. **Now test your `index.html` file in the browser. You should see the skeleton of a web page coming together.**
<img src="assets/images/example2.png" alt="Small Image" width="300" height="300">
Next, we can add some styling.

### Let's add some CSS code to our `styles.css` file

     Copy the CSS code provided by the AI and paste it at the bottom of your `styles.css` file.

2. **Set Background Image for the Entire Page**
   - **What to ask AI:**
     Can you provide me with CSS code to set a background image for the entire page using an image located at `assets/images/Background.jpg`? The image should cover the whole page and adjust responsively.
   - **Where to place the provided code:**
     Copy the CSS code provided by the AI and paste it next in your `styles.css` file.
